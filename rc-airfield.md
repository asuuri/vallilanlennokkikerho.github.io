## WELCOME TO VALLILAN LENNOKKIKERHO

We are Helsinki’s most active and historic RC model aircraft club, catering to all ages and skill levels. Regular gatherings at our **Talosaari airfield** allow for flying various models, including fixed-wing planes, helicopters, and multirotors.

Our airfield features:

- A well-maintained grass runway for smooth takeoffs and landings.
- A pilot's area equipped with benches and tables for resting and preparing models.
- Pit tables, chairs, a charcoal grill, and a notice board with the latest field rules and club information.

Whether you are a beginner honing your skills or an experienced pilot enjoying the thrill of flight, Talosaari RC Airfield provides an ideal setting for all your model aviation activities.

## MODEL AIRCRAFT FIELD

Having a great place to fly is essential for our hobby, and we’re proud to have our own model aircraft field at **Talosaarentie 108** in Helsinki, near the Sipoo border. Talosaari is the only RC airfield in Helsinki and a cornerstone of our club. Designed for small to medium-sized models, it offers a unique flying experience surrounded by nature. Our field is maintained by club members who volunteer their time, including an annual maintenance day where active members help mow the lawn and keep everything in tip-top shape.

To fly at our field, simply pay the club membership fee and register as a drone operator with Traficom. Ensure your model aircraft has your name, contact details, and drone operator ID on it.

**Important!** There’s a horse stable behind the forest opposite our field. Horses can get spooked easily, which can be dangerous. Please avoid flying over the forest and the areas beyond it, and exercise caution with large gas-powered models due to the noise. If you see horses nearby, consider not using large models at all.
