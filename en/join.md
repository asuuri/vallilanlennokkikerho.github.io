Send your application to: **<vallilanlennokkikerho@gmail.com>**

We warmly encourage members to take part in volunteer work. It’s a great way to contribute to the club, build community spirit, and strengthen our shared enthusiasm. Working together brings joy and gives everyone the chance to be involved and make a positive impact.
