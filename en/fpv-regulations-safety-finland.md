Flying FPV in Finland is fun and rewarding, but it comes with important legal and safety responsibilities. This guide summarizes the key regulations, safety practices, and resources for FPV pilots in Finland.

### Key Regulations for FPV Pilots in Finland

#### Registration and Operator Requirements

- **Drone Registration:** All drones over 250g (or with a camera, unless it's a toy drone compliant with Directive 2009/48/EC) must be registered with Traficom (Finnish Transport and Communications Agency).
- **Operator ID:** Pilots must obtain an operator ID and display it on their aircraft.
- **EASA Rules:** Finland follows EU-wide drone regulations (EASA). Check [Traficom’s drone info](https://www.traficom.fi/en/transport/drone) for details.

#### Flying Permissions and Zones

- **Open Category:** Most hobby FPV flying falls under the Open Category. No special permit is needed, but rules apply.
- **Geofencing:** Use apps like [Droneinfo.fi](https://www.droneinfo.fi/en) to check for restricted zones (airports, military areas, nature reserves).
- **Altitude Limit:** Maximum altitude is 120 meters above ground level unless otherwise permitted.
- **No-Fly Zones:** Respect all restricted areas. Flying near airports, prisons, or critical infrastructure is strictly prohibited.

#### Visual Line of Sight (VLOS) and Spotters

- **VLOS Requirement:** FPV pilots must maintain visual line of sight (VLOS) of the aircraft, either directly or with a competent spotter.
- **Spotter Role:** The spotter must be co-located with the pilot, maintain unaided visual contact with the drone at all times, scan the surrounding airspace for potential hazards, and communicate effectively with the FPV pilot. The FPV pilot remains the remote pilot in command.

#### Insurance and Privacy

- **Insurance:** Liability insurance is strongly recommended. Some clubs include insurance in their membership.
- **Privacy Laws:** Do not record or share footage of people without consent. Respect privacy, especially in residential areas.

#### Age and Training

- **Competency Requirements:** Pilots operating drones that require registration (most FPV drones used in Open Category subcategories A1, A2, and A3) must pass the free online training and test provided by Traficom.
- **Age Considerations:** While younger pilots can take the online test, those under 16 flying drones that are not C0 class or privately built under 250g, or are not toys, usually require supervision by a competent adult who holds the necessary qualifications.

### Safety Guidelines for FPV Flying in Finland

- **Pre-Flight Checklist:** Check weather, battery levels, firmware, and airspace restrictions before each flight.
- **Winter Flying:** Cold affects batteries and electronics. Keep batteries warm, avoid condensation, and check for ice on props.
- **Emergency Procedures:** Know how to disarm your drone quickly and have a plan for lost signal or flyaways.
- **First Aid:** Bring a basic first aid kit to flying sessions, especially in remote areas.
- **Community Support:** Join local clubs or online groups for safety tips and updates on regulations.
