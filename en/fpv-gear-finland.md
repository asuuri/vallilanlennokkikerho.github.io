Choosing the right FPV gear is crucial for a safe and enjoyable flying experience, especially in Finland's challenging climate. This guide covers the essential equipment, local purchasing options, and practical tips for Finnish pilots.

### Essential FPV Gear

#### FPV Drone

- **Types:** Racing, freestyle, cinematic, micro/Tiny Whoop, and fixed-wing (see [FPV Aircraft](/en/what-is-fpv/aircraft/)).
- **Ready-to-Fly (RTF) vs. Build-Your-Own:** Beginners may start with RTF kits, while experienced pilots often build custom drones for better performance and repairability.
- **Weatherproofing:** Consider conformal coating for electronics and other waterproofing measures for winter and wet conditions.

#### Radio Transmitter (Controller)

- **Popular Brands:** FrSky, Radiomaster, Jumper, FlySky, TBS.
- **Mode:** Most Finnish pilots use Mode 2 (throttle on the left stick).
- **Compatibility:** Ensure your transmitter is compatible with your drone's receiver (e.g., ELRS, Crossfire, FrSky D8/D16).

#### FPV Goggles

- **Types:** Analog (lower cost, lower latency, more community support) and digital (higher image quality, e.g., DJI, Walksnail Avatar, HDZero).
- **Features:** Diversity receivers, DVR recording, comfortable fit for long sessions.
- **Winter Use:** Use anti-fog inserts and consider a hat or balaclava for outdoor winter flying.

#### Batteries and Charging

- **Types:** LiPo (most common for performance), Li-ion (for long-range/fixed-wing endurance).
- **Cold Weather Tips:** Keep batteries warm before flight (inside jacket or insulated bag). Avoid flying with cold batteries as voltage sag is more pronounced.
- **Charging Safety:** Always use a LiPo-safe charger, charge in a fire-resistant bag or container, and never leave charging batteries unattended.

#### Tools and Spare Parts

- **Essentials:** Propellers, screws, zip ties, soldering iron & solder, multimeter, electrical tape, and basic hand tools (hex drivers, nut drivers).
- **Field Kit:** Bring spare props, batteries, tools, and a small repair kit to flying sessions.

### Where to Buy FPV Gear in Finland

#### Online Retailers

- **International:** Banggood, GetFPV, Rotor Riot, Unmanned Tech, and others ship to Finland. Check for customs fees (VAT is usually applied at purchase for EU shipments or by customs for non-EU) and delivery times.
- **Second-Hand:** Tori.fi, Facebook groups (e.g., "FPV Finland K&M" - Kauppa & Myynti), and club forums are good sources for used gear.

#### Community Recommendations

- Ask for advice in local FPV Facebook groups or at club meetings before making big purchases.
- Many pilots are willing to let newcomers try their gear at meetups.

### Tips for Choosing and Maintaining Gear in Finland

- **Weather Adaptation:** Choose gear rated for cold and moisture. Use silicone wires and waterproof or conformal coat ESCs and flight controllers if possible.
- **Battery Care:** Store batteries at room temperature and at storage voltage (around 3.8V per cell for LiPo) when not in use for extended periods.
- **Firmware Updates:** Keep your transmitter, goggles, and flight controller firmware up to date for best performance, new features, and safety.
- **Insurance:** Consider liability insurance, especially if flying in public areas. Club memberships often include this.

### Getting Started

- **Simulators:** Practice with FPV simulators (e.g., Liftoff, Velocidrone, DRL Simulator, Uncrashed) before your first real flight.
- **Starter Kits:** Many shops offer beginner bundles (RTF - Ready-to-Fly, or BNF - Bind-and-Fly with your existing controller) with everything needed to start flying.

With the right gear and preparation, you'll be ready to enjoy FPV flying in Finland year-round.
