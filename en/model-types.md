## Trainer Aircraft

Trainer aircraft are perfect for beginners due to their stable, forgiving design. Featuring high-wing placement for self-righting stability, large wings for slow flight (20–40 km/h), and durable foam construction (EPO/EPP), they handle winds up to 15 km/h and survive minor crashes. Examples include the *HobbyZone AeroScout S 2* with SAFE technology and the *Volantex Ranger 1600 V2* for affordability. These planes are easy to control, affordable in RTF (Ready-to-Fly) packages, but offer limited aerobatics and may feel slow as skills grow. Start with an RTF trainer to focus on flying, not building, and expect solo flight in 10–15 hours with guidance.

## Gliders/Sailplanes

Gliders are designed for long, graceful flights, using thermals, slopes, or motors to stay aloft. Types include thermal gliders for rising air, slope gliders for wind-driven lift, hand-launched DLG/F3K gliders, and electric gliders for easy climbs. With long, narrow wings (glide ratio 15:1 to 25:1) and lightweight balsa or composite builds, they cruise at 30–50 km/h but are sensitive to winds over 10 km/h. Examples like the *Volantex Phoenix 2000* suit beginners, while the *Radian Pro* offers strong glide performance. Best for pilots with 6+ months of experience, gliders provide long flights (20+ minutes) and teach energy management but require large fields (100x100m+) and are weather-dependent. Choose an electric glider for easier launches.

---

## Sport Models

Sport models bridge the gap between trainers and advanced planes, offering speed and basic aerobatics like loops and rolls while remaining forgiving. Their mid- or low-wing design and aerodynamic shape make them agile. Models like the *FMS Viper 70mm* or *Phoenix Model Spitfire* are great for pilots with basic skills ready for a second plane. They balance stability and performance but require more precision than trainers. Master a trainer first for a smoother transition.

---

## 3D Models

Built for extreme aerobatics like hovering and spins, 3D models feature large control surfaces, lightweight foam (EPP) or composite builds, and high power-to-weight ratios. Examples include the *E-flite Extra 300 3D* and *Extreme Flight Edge 540*. Suited for experienced pilots with quick reflexes, they offer thrilling, unlimited aerobatic potential but aren’t beginner-friendly and crashes can be costly. Practice on a simulator like *RealFlight* to build 3D skills before flying.

---

## Scale Models

Scale models are detailed replicas of real aircraft, emphasizing realism in appearance and flight. Ranging from small foam models like the *FMS Spitfire 1400mm* to large fuel-powered kits like the *Top Flite P-51 Mustang*, they feature accurate details like cockpits and landing gear but are less stable and more fragile. Best for intermediate to advanced pilots who enjoy history and building, they’re visually stunning but expensive and require skilled flying. Start with a foam scale model for easier handling.

---

## Flying Wings

Flying wings are tailless aircraft with a single wing, ideal for FPV or slope soaring. Their simple, durable design uses elevons for control and supports rear-mounted motors for cameras. Examples include the *SonicModell AR.Wing Pro* for FPV and *Multiplex FunWing* for agility. Best for intermediate pilots, they’re efficient and durable but tricky to trim and less stable at low speeds. Ensure proper elevon setup and practice in open areas.

---

## Free Flight Models

Free flight models fly without radio control, relying on precise trimming for stable, autonomous flight. Disciplines include towline gliders (F1A), rubber-powered models (F1B), and indoor models (F1D). They deepen understanding of aerodynamics and don’t require expensive radio gear but demand precise craftsmanship and can be hard to retrieve after long flights. Start with simple designs and test in calm conditions.

---

## Helicopters

Helicopters, with their rotating blades, offer unique hovering and maneuvering capabilities. Ranging from small indoor models to large outdoor ones like the *Align T-Rex 450*, they feature complex controls (pitch, yaw, roll) and advanced stabilization electronics. Best for pilots seeking a challenging flying style, they’re exciting but have a steep learning curve and costly repairs. Use a simulator to practice controls first.

---

## Multirotors (Drones)

Multirotors, like quadcopters or hexacopters, use 4–8 rotors with GPS and sensors for stable, easy control, ideal for photography or FPV racing. Models like the *DJI Mini 4 Pro* excel in photography, while the *BetaFPV Cetus Pro* is built for racing. They’re great for tech enthusiasts but have shorter flight times (10–20 min) and face flying restrictions. Drone pilots can apply similar safety and regulation principles as winged aircraft.

---

## Electric vs. Fuel Engines

Most RC aircraft can use electric or fuel engines. Electric engines are quiet, clean, easy to use, and ideal for beginners but have shorter flight times (5–15 min) and require costly batteries. Fuel engines (nitro/gasoline) offer longer flights (20–30 min) and realistic sound but are noisy, messy, and need maintenance. Start with electric for simplicity, especially for trainers or gliders.

---

## Choosing Your Aircraft

To pick the right model:

- **Beginners**: Choose a trainer or electric glider with an RTF package, foam construction (EPO/EPP), and 1–1.5m wingspan for stability and visibility.
- **Intermediate/Advanced**: Match your goals—gliders for relaxation, 3D models for thrills, or scale models for realism. Consider field size: small spaces suit drones or trainers; large fields fit gliders or scale models. Decide between building or ready-made based on time and skills.
- **General Tips**: Consult experienced pilots at [Talosaari field](/en/rc-airfield/), practice on simulators (*RealFlight*, *Aerofly RC*), check spare part availability, and review local regulations at [droneinfo.fi](https://droneinfo.fi/en).
