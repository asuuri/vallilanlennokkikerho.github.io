## What You Need to Start Flying

FPV is affordable and beginner-friendly. Here’s the essential gear to kick off your journey:

- **Aircraft (Drone or Plane)**: Choose a drone like the *BetaFPV Meteor65 Pro* (micro-drone) or *iFlight Nazgul Evoque* (5-inch freestyle) for beginners. For fixed-wing FPV, try the *Volantex Ranger 1600*. [Learn more about model types](/en/model-types/).
- **FPV Goggles**: Digital systems like *DJI Goggles 2* or *HDZero VRX* offer crisp visuals. Budget-friendly analog options like *Eachine EV800D* are great for starters.
- **Controller**: Reliable options include the *Radiomaster Boxer* (ELRS) or the compact *TBS Tango 2*.
- **Batteries**: High-performance LiPo batteries from *CNHL* or *Tattu R-Line* ensure long flights and durability.
- **Simulator**: Practice with *VelociDrone* (racing) or *Uncrashed* (freestyle) to build skills risk-free.

**Pro Tip**: Stick to EU-approved equipment to stay legal. Local shops and FPV communities can guide you. A beginner setup typically costs €150–€300.

### Choosing an FPV Camera

A small camera on your drone streams live video to your goggles or screen. Low latency (delay) is key for smooth control. Here’s what to look for:

- **Resolution**: 720p or 1080p for clear obstacle detection.
- **Lens**: Wide-angle (120–150° FOV) for a broader view.
- **Low-Light Performance**: Cameras with f/2.0 or better shine in dim conditions.
- **Video Link**: Choose digital systems (e.g., *DJI O3 Air Unit* or *HDZero Nano*) for clarity or analog (*Caddx Walrus*) for affordability.

**Popular Picks**: 
- Micro drones: *Caddx Walrus* (analog) or *HDZero Nano* (digital).
- Larger builds: *DJI O3 Pro* or *Walksnail Avatar* systems.

You can also use FPV for aerial photography or videography, but always check local regulations.
