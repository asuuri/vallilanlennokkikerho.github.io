### Popular FPV Flying Spots in Finland

- **Urban Parks and Open Fields:** Many cities have designated RC or drone flying fields. Always check local rules on [Droneinfo.fi](https://www.droneinfo.fi/en) and avoid crowded areas.
- **Forests and Nature Areas:** Finland’s forests offer unique freestyle and cinematic flying opportunities. Respect nature reserves and protected areas—check for restrictions before flying.
- **Indoor Venues:** During winter, clubs organize indoor flying sessions in sports halls, gyms, or community centers. Tiny Whoop and micro drone races are especially popular.
- **RC Airfields:** Many RC clubs welcome FPV pilots. These fields are ideal for both multirotor and fixed-wing flying.
- **Coastal and Lake Areas:** Open spaces near lakes and the sea are great for long-range and cinematic flights. Always be mindful of wildlife and local regulations.

### Annual FPV Events and Competitions
